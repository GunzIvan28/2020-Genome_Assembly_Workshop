Bioinformatics: Genome Assembly Workshop @ UC Davis  
Jul. 20, 2019, 9 a.m. - Jul. 23, 2019, 4:30 p.m.  
Organizer - Bioinformatics Core  
Contact - UC Davis Bioinformatics Core, training.bioinformatics@ucdavis.edu

Genome Assembly is currently in a renaissance, with new technologies coming together to complement each other, producing high-quality reference grade assemblies. This workshop will focus on project design, library and sequencing technologies, genome assembly and data type integration process, and evaluation in a practical and informative setting.

The format will be approximately half lecture and half hands-on. The hands-on portion of the workshop will  involve command-line interaction with some R, therefore prior command-line and R experience is a must to fully participate. If you are not familiar with the command line but would like to attend, listen, and learn that is OK, but we will be unable to train you in how to use the command-line and R during this workshop.

This workshop will be held remotely over Zoom and Slack and will run from 9:00am to 5:00pm each day.

Participants must bring their own laptops to use, which should have a recent version of R, Rstudio, and Java installed, and an application that allows them to ssh into a server (e.g. Bash for Windows, or Terminal for Apple), as well as the ability to connect to the internet via wifi.

What do I need to bring? … You will need to bring your own laptop to use, have a recent version of R, Rstudio, and Java installed, and an application that will allow you to ssh into a server (e.g. Bash for Windows, or Terminal for Apple) as well as the ability to connect to the internet via wifi. Computational exercises will be performed on a remote server. We can help with setup early on in the workshop. If your department does not allow you to install software on the laptop you’ll be bringing, please contact us ahead of time.

Can I bring my own data? … We will provide experimental datasets for use during the workshop, as this helps to keep the workshop moving. There will be time, however, to discuss your own datasets and how you might work with them outside of the workshop.

How much does it cost? … The registration fee is $1,000 for UC students, postdocs, staff and faculty, $1,200 for Non-UC academic or non-profit participants and $1,700 for other participants. Late registrations (less than one month prior to the start of the workshop) are subject to a 20% fee increase. We accept credit cards, as well as UC Davis recharge accounts, for payment.  Registration fees include light breakfast, lunch, and snacks, but do not include dinner, lodging or parking fees.

Where is the workshop? … It will be held in the Multi-Purpose Room at the Student Community Center on the UC Davis campus, and will run from 9:00am to 5:00pm on the dates indicated.

How do I apply? … All registration is “first-come, first-served.” There is no application process. Sign up as soon as possible to ensure your place in the workshop.
